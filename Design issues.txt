Design issues:
	- boolean return values could be replace with OperationResponse objects
	- It might be better to name fake endpoints with Mock prefix
	- Might pass to TransferFacility methods a user object instead of id
	  And let the controller handle the Repository query.

What Next?
	- Everyone please study Spring Boot (even a little intro and dummy app)
	- I will try to add Dependency Injection
	- I will try to take on ALL in-memory repositories implementation
	- We need to design the Register/Login componenet as well

	- THAT SHOULD COVER THE REQUIRMENTS! HOORAY!
